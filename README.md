# JakProject
Hello!

I had some issues with uploading the project onto Github, so I've removed a lot of unnecessary files.

The camera blueprints are in:

> Content
>> ThirdPerson
>>> Blueprints
>>>> CameraSystems

The editor should open in the TrainingMap level, which is where I've laid out the camera systems on a nice display platform. :)
